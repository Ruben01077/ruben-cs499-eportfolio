        <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
        <p class="small">
          <strong>Artifact:</strong> CS 340 Grazioso Salvare Dashboard (Python/Dash + MongoDB data)<br/>
          <strong>Originally Created:</strong> CS 340 (Advanced Programming Concepts)<br/>
          <strong>Category:</strong> Algorithms and Data Structures
        </p>

        <p>
          The dashboard loads animal shelter data and allows users to apply rescue-type filters, select records, view mapped coordinates,
          and explore a pie chart visualization. For this enhancement, I focused on the algorithmic logic used to build filter queries,
          process datasets, and generate charts in a way that is both efficient and reliable for real-world usage.

        <h2>Why This Artifact Belongs in My ePortfolio</h2>
        <p>
          I selected this artifact for the algorithms and data structures category because it highlights how algorithmic decisions affect
          an application's performance and correctness. The dashboard is data-driven, which makes it ideal for demonstrating filtering logic,
          defensive programming for edge cases, and efficiency considerations when transforming data for visualization. These are practical
          algorithm skills that apply directly to backend and full-stack development.

          <h2>Original Limitations</h2>
          <p class="small">
            The original version handled filtering and display correctly but did not fully emphasize algorithmic clarity and robustness.
            Limitations included: (1) inconsistent handling of empty results, (2) limited defensive checks before running transformations,
            (3) visualization logic that could produce unclear results when categories were large, and (4) less explicit separation of query
            building versus display logic, which made future extensions harder.

        <div class="card card-pad">
          <h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>
          <p class="small">
            For this enhancement, I improved the algorithmic flow by: (1) implementing a clear query-building function that maps each rescue
            selection to explicit constraints, (2) adding defensive handling when datasets are empty or missing required columns,
            (3) improving the data transformation logic used before visualization (filtering, removing nulls, selecting meaningful categories),
            and (4) ensuring the map and chart updates remain stable regardless of user selection.

        <div class="card card-pad">
          <h2>Impact of Changes</h2>
          <p class="small">
            These improvements make the dashboard more reliable and consistent. Filtering is now easier to understand, evaluate, and extend.
            The data-processing logic reduces the chance of runtime errors, improves chart accuracy, and provides better user feedback when
            no data is available. Overall, the application behaves more predictably and demonstrates stronger problem-solving using algorithmic principles.

        <h2>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h2>
        <p class="small">
          This artifact demonstrates CS 499 outcomes by applying algorithmic reasoning and professional communication:
        </p>

        <ul class="small">
          <li><strong>Outcome 3 (Algorithms & Trade-offs):</strong> I designed and evaluated filtering and transformation logic with attention to correctness, efficiency, and maintainability trade-offs.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome 2 (Communication):</strong> I improved clarity through structured functions and explanations that make the logic easier for others to follow and review.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome 4 (Tools & Practices):</strong> I used Python, pandas, and Dash to implement practical data processing and visualization workflows used in real applications.</li>

        <h2>Design Trade-offs and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          In this enhancement, a key trade-off was balancing performance with readability. For example, structuring the rescue filter logic
          into a dedicated query-building function improves clarity and makes future modifications easier, even if it adds a small amount of
          abstraction. Similarly, defensive checks for empty datasets add a few extra conditional steps, but they significantly improve stability
          and user experience. These choices reflect a professional approach: prioritize correctness and maintainability while still keeping the
          logic efficient for typical dataset sizes.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Enhancing this artifact helped me understand how important algorithmic structure is in data-driven applications. I learned that the
          best solution is not only one that works, but one that is consistent, predictable, and easy to evaluate. A major challenge was ensuring
          the dashboard continued to update correctly when users changed filters or when the dataset contained missing values. By adding defensive
          handling and improving the data transformation steps, I strengthened the reliability of the application and demonstrated a more professional
          approach to algorithm design and evaluation.
